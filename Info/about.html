<p>Hello everyone! My name is Monty Montanez. I'm 27 years old and I was born in
  Safford, Arizona. I've lived all around Arizona most of my life, but I eventually moved
  to Phoenix. It was from there that I graduate high school and joined the U.S. Navy.</p>

<p>I left for boot camp back in 2014 to Great Lakes, Illinois. I spent about 4 months total there,
between bootcamp and my technical school. After that, I got my orders to the USS Fort McHenry which was
stationed in Jacksonville, Florida. Whilst aboard the USS Fort McHenry I did 2 deployments, one Operation and
plenty of port visits across the east coast. I've been to Rota, Spain, Valencia, Spain and A Coruna, Spain,
Manama, Bahrain, Aqaba, Jordan (3x), Bar/Budva, Montenegro, Lisbon, Portugal, Trondheim, Norway, Amsterdam, Netherlands,
Constanta, Romania (along with the capital) and lastly Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>I left the Navy in June, 2019. I am now going to school at the University of Arizona to be a Software Engineer. I'm taking
this Udemy course so I can be more proficient in various things, such as web development.</p>

Thank you for taking the time to read about me!</p>
